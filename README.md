## Network talker

A simple program for practicing threaded server/client TCP sockets.

The program consists of a client and a server part. The user can connect to another node. When connected, the client and server will send eachother socket information every second.

## Code stuff

I tried to keep the code modular and general so it can be easily be used in other programs.
